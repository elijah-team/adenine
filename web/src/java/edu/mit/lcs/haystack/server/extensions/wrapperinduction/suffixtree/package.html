Please replace the package status with one of the following descriptions:
    core        = central to active haystack application
    depricated  = still in use but on its way out
    abandoned   = not in use; no further interest in development
    on hold     = not in use; interested in developing further
    in progress = not in use but actively being developed
-->

<p>This package contains an implementation of the Suffix Tree data
structure, originally described by P. Weiner, Linear pattern matching
algorithms, in <em>Proc. 14th IEEE Symposium on Switching and Automata
Theory</em>, pg 1-11, 1973.  </p>

<p>In addition, an extension to hierarchical structures, the Suffix
Multitree, is included, as described <a
href="http://secondthought.org/notes/6.854-final-project.ps">here</a>.</p>

<p>Both structures contain functions for locating repetitive
structures in their respective data types (strings or trees).  The
Suffix Tree implementation is complete and functional.  The Suffix
Multitree implementation is also functional, although more testing is
required.

<p>Further references are listed below.
