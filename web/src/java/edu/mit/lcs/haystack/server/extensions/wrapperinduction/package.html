Please replace the package status with one of the following descriptions:
    core        = central to active haystack application
    depricated  = still in use but on its way out
    abandoned   = not in use; no further interest in development
    on hold     = not in use; interested in developing further
    in progress = not in use but actively being developed
-->

<p>This package contains the basic interfaces and classes that make up
the wrapper induction implementation.  Wrapper induction is a method
for deriving patterns on the Web based on user input.  For more
information, see my <a
href="http://secondthought.org/notes/thesisProposal.ps">thesis
proposal</a>.

<p>Classes in this package depend on some of the core Haystack RDF
functionality, especially @see edu.mit.lcs.haystack.rdf.  

<p>Currently, there should be no dependencies of other packages on the
classes in this package.

<p>Further references are listed below.
