<!--
Please replace the package status with one of the following descriptions:
    core        = central to active haystack application
    depricated  = still in use but on its way out
    abandoned   = not in use; no further interest in development
    on hold     = not in use; interested in developing further
    in progress = not in use but actively being developed
-->

<p>This is a test package for the classes and interfaces in @see
edu.mit.lcs.haystack.wrapperinduction.  Currently it contains a
wrapper induction interface using Internet Explorer, along with some
stand-alone applications for testing.

<p>Classes in this package depend on some of the core Haystack RDF
functionality, especially @see edu.mit.lcs.haystack.rdf, as well as
some ozone parts (@see edu.mit.lcs.haystack.ozone).

<p>Currently, there should be no dependencies of other packages on the
classes in this package.

<p>Further references are listed below.

<!-- replace with actual references -->
