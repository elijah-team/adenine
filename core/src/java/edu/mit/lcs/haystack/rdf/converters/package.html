<p><b>matsakis:</b>Converters between RDF and other file formats (VCARD, etc.)

<!--
Please replace the package status with one of the following descriptions:
    core        = central to active haystack application
    depricated  = still in use but on its way out
    abandoned   = not in use; no further interest in development
    on hold     = not in use; interested in developing further
    in progress = not in use but actively being developed
-->

<p>This is a skeleton of a framework for converting between different
file formats, text or otherwise, and RDF.  The basic idea is that for
each format we need to define a 'parser' and a 'generator'.  The hope
is that we can maintain a mapping between MIME types and this code, so
that when the user wants to import/export data the appropriate
converter can be found dynamically.

<p>This package should depend on no other part of Haystack besides the
RDF framework and java core libraries. Further references are listed
below.
